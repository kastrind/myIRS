Abstract
Background: Termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves at least two polypeptide
release factors (eRFs) – eRF1 and eRF3. The highly conserved translation termination factor eRF1
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded by the essential gene SUP45.
Results: We have isolated five sup45-n (n from nonsense) mutations that cause nonsense
substitutions in the following amino acid positions of eRF1: Y53 ? UAA, E266 ? UAA, L283 ?
UAA, L317 ? UGA, E385 ? UAA. We found that full-length eRF1 protein is present in all mutants,
although in decreased amounts. All mutations are situated in a weak termination context. All these
sup45-n mutations are viable in different genetic backgrounds, however their viability increases
after growth in the absence of wild-type allele. Any of sup45-n mutations result in temperature
sensitivity (37°C). Most of the sup45-n mutations lead to decreased spore viability and spores
bearing sup45-n mutations are characterized by limited budding after germination leading to
formation of microcolonies of 4–20 cells.
Conclusions: Nonsense mutations in the essential gene SUP45 can be isolated in the absence of
tRNA nonsense suppressors.
Background
Termination of protein synthesis occurs when the ribosome elongation machinery encounters an in-frame termination (stop) codon, either UAG, UGA or UAA, in the mRNA. This stop codon located in the A-site of the ribosome is recognized by a release factor (RF1/RF2 in prokaryotes and eRF1 in eukaryotes), which triggers release of the nascent peptide from the ribosome. Termination efficiency is enhanced by the GTPase release factor, RF3 in prokaryotes and eRF3 in eukaryotes [reviewed in [1–4]]. Release factor eRF1 recognizes all three stop codons [5], in contrast to prokaryotes where RF1 catalyses translation termination at UAG and UAA codons, and RF2 at UGA and UAA codons [6]. All these proteins are encoded by essential genes: prfA (for RF1), prfB (for RF2) in bacteria [7–9] and SUP45 (for eRF1) in S. cerevisiae [10,11]. Although the sequences of prokaryotic and eukaryotic release factors differ significantly [see [12] for review], a "tRNAmimicry" model generalizing the mechanisms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation termination, was proposed [13]. Peptide determinants of RF1 and RF2 involved in the specificity of stop codon recognition have been identified:
in both cases a tripeptide (PAT for RF1 and SPF for RF2) was located in the homologous region of both proteins
[14]. Recently the crystal structures of human eRF1 and bacterial RF2 have been determined and found to be different [15,17]. However, when associated to the ribosome RF2, conformation is modified and mimics a tRNA molecule [16,18]. Thus both eRF1 and RF2 may have comparable structures both of which are compatible with tRNA mimicry model as proposed previously [13]. The eRF1 is composed of three domains. Domain 3 corresponds to the Cterminal part of eRF1 that is necessary for the interaction with eRF3 although there are some discrepancies in the precise localization of the region of eRF1 that interacts with eRF3 [19–22]. Domain 2 is responsible for the peptidyl transferase hydrolytic activity and includes a GGQ motif that has been highly conserved through evolution [23]. Mutations of GGQ (Gly residues) are dominant-negative in vitro [23] and lethal in vivo in S. cerevisiae cells [15]. The function of domain 1 remains unknown although it was proposed that together with domain 2, it could form a functionally active "core" domain [24]. The role of Nterminal
domain of eRF1 in stop codon recognition has been proposed [15] and supported by mutational approach
[25] and crosslinking experiments [26]. In eukaryotes eRF1 interacts with eRF3 in vivo [27,28]. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of eRF1 [20,21]. The deletion of the 19 C-terminal amino acids abolishes the interaction with eRF3, causes an enhancement of nonsense suppression, but does not destroy viability. In contrast, eRF1 with a 32 C-terminal amino acid deletion is unable to support viability [20]. Also it has
been shown that nonsense mutations (UAA) in the SUP45 gene lead to lethality in the absence of SUQ5 suppressor [29]. However, a viable nonsense mutant has been isolated for the prfB gene of S. typhimurium encoding RF2 release factor. It has been proposed that this mutation reduces the cellular amount of RF2 leading to inefficient termination of translation and autosuppression [30]. In the present work we have isolated five spontaneous nonsense mutations in the SUP45 gene that confer viability in different genetic backgrounds. These mutations result in a decreased level of full-length eRF1, thermosensitivity and lethality in meiotic segregation of
heterozygous diploids.


Results
Isolation of nonsense mutations in the SUP45 gene
After selection for histidine (his7-1 (UAA)) – lysine (lys9-A21 (UAA)) prototrophy, sixteen SUP45 mutants and
eighty-four SUP35 mutants among 400 His+ Lys+ revertants were obtained. All sup45 mutant alleles together
with the wild-type SUP45 allele from parent strain 1BD1606 were cloned using PCR. The DNA sequence for
each of the cloned alleles was determined. The sequencing of the parent strain 1B-D1606 revealed 6
nucleotide substitutions compared with the published sequence [10]: A69G, G519T, T687C, T702A, G927A,
T1008C. All of these, except T702, are the same as those described earlier [10] for mutant alleles that obviously
had a different origin regarding the wild-type strain. All nucleotide substitutions are localized in the third codon
position and do not change the amino acid residues. The reason for these differences could be the origin of the
strain from Petergoff Breeding Stocks (XII race S. cerevisiae) that has an independent origin [31] compared to the strains used in other laboratories [32]. Comparison of the mutant SUP45 DNA sequences with
that of the parent strain revealed that in all cases only a single-base changed in the coding sequence. Surprisingly,
among 16 mutations 5 represented nonsense mutations, resulting in the mutations of sense codon to an ochre
(TAA) (four mutations) or (TAG) nonsense codon (one mutation) (Figure 1). The other 9 were missense mutations and will be described elsewhere. Strains bearing sup45-101, sup45-102, sup45-104, sup45-105, sup45-107 that contain, respectively, the following base substitutions: G796T, T159A, T848A, G1153T and T950G, which lead to nonsense mutations, were further characterized. 

Nonsense mutations in the SUP45 gene lead to readthrough of the mutated stop codon
All the mutations were defined as omnipotent suppressors after testing for histidine, lysine, adenine and tryptophan auxotrophy; his7-1 (UAA), lys9-A21 (UAA,) ade1-14 (UGA) and trp1-289 (UAG) mutation one present in the parent strain (Figure 2A). To determine the level of nonsense suppression in the different
SUP45 mutants a vector based assay system for quantification of nonsense codon readthroughin vivo was
employed [33]. â-galactosidase activities measurements in the mutants are consistent with the results obtained for auxotrophy (Figure 2A): the parent strain does not possess any suppressor activity. In the omnipotent mutants tested, nonsense suppression levels of all stop codons were high (between 8- and 28% for UAA; between 10- and 25% for UAG, and between 22- and 42% for UGA) (Figure 2B). Since the C-terminal region of eRF1 is essential for cell viability [10,11], some full-length eRF1 should be present even in strains bearing sup45 nonsense mutations (which will be referred to as sup45-n, where n equals nonsense), probably by readthrough of the stop codon. An affinitypurified anti-eRF1 antibody was used in the Western blot analysis to examine eRF1 levels in SUP45 mutants. As shown in Figure 2C, there was a considerable amount of full-length eRF1 in sup45-n strains. Comparison with a wild-type strain revealed a significant decrease in the amount of eRF1 protein. Ribosome fractions isolated from sup45-104, sup45-105, sup45-107 contained a truncated protein with molecular mass consistent with the predicted one (31.5, 43.0 and 35.2 kDa, respectively) (Figure 2C).
Western blot analysis did not reveal the presence of truncated protein either in ribosome fractions, or in lysates
prepared from sup45-101 strain (Figure 2C and data not shown). The inability to detect such truncated protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 29.6 kDa could be explained by its proteolytic sensitivity possibly because of
the absence of the ribosome-binding site. The small truncated protein (5.9 kDa) in sup45-102 strain could not be
detected. Relative to the level of eRF1 in wild-type strain 1B-D1606 (set to 1), the amount of full-length eRF1 in
101-D1606, 102-D1606, 104-D1606, 105-D1606 and 107-D1606 strains were 0.32, 0.08, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.17,
respectively. The highest level of eRF1 in sup45-101 strain corresponds to the lowest level of suppression as measured by â-galactosidase assay (Figure 2B). These results suggest that a very small amount of eRF1 is required for cell viability. The effect of reducing eRF1 on cell viability was evaluated next. All sup45-n mutations (but not all missense mutations, data not shown) lead to temperature-sensitive lethality (Figure 3). Previously, the analogous phenotype

Do sup45-n mutations lead to lethality in different genetic backgrounds?
The viability of strains bearing nonsense mutations in the essential SUP45 gene may be explained in several ways. It is possible that the parent strain itself contains weak tRNA suppressor. However, the level of readthrough in this strain, measured in a quantitative termination codon readthrough assay, is negligible (Figure 2B). To further examine this possibility plasmid shuffle analysis was performed. The haploid yeast strain 1A-D1628 was transformed with the pRS315 plasmids bearing different sup45-n mutations. In this strain the lethal SUP45 disruption was complemented by the SUP45 gene on an URA3 centromeric plasmid, pRS316. Transformants were then subjected to plasmid shuffle analysis [34] to verify whether strains containing the sup45-n alleles could lose the plasmid carrying the wild-type gene. Leu+ Ura+ transformants were plated on 5-FOA medium to select against [URA3 SUP45] plasmid. Control cells transformed with [LEU2 SUP45] plasmid grew on 5-FOA. Cells transformed with pRS315/sup45-n plasmids also grew on 5-FOA medium although with different efficiencies (Figure 4A). Ura-Leu+ colonies were selected and tested for adenine and tryptophan auxotrophy. In all cases sup45-n mutations lead to suppression of ade1-14 and trp1-289 (Figure 4B).
Again, the Western blot analysis showed that in all SUP45::HIS3 [sup45-n] strains full-length eRF1 had been
synthesized to a lesser extent compared with SUP45::HIS3 [SUP45] strain (Figure 4C).
To further confirm that viability of sup45-n mutations could not be explained by the presence of weak tRNA suppressor mutation in the parent strain plasmid, shuffle analysis was performed on the derivative of S288C [35]
whose entire genomic sequence does not contain mutations in tRNA genes [36]. A haploid strain 1A-Y23282
bearing SUP45 disruption and the [URA3 SUP45] plasmid pRS316/SUP45 was transformed with [LEU2 sup45-n] plasmids and the resulting transformants were plated on 5-FOA medium. All transformants were able to grow in the presence of 5-FOA (Figure 4D). The comparison of data presented in Figures 4A and 4D shows that the efficiency of the plasmid shuffle varies significantly among mutations being the least for sup45-105 and the highest for sup45-101. To compare the efficiency of plasmid shuffle quantitatively the maintenance of plasmid
with wild-type SUP45 was tested. The haploid yeast strain 1A-D1628 carrying the SUP45 gene on centromeric
plasmid pRS315 was transformed with pRS316 plasmids bearing different sup45-n mutations. Cotransformants
were plated at 200 cells per Petri dish on YPD medium, grown at 25°C for several days and replica plated on SCUra and SC-Leu media. 200 to 500 colonies were tested from 3 independent transformants. All cotransformants were able to lose either [SUP45 LEU2] or [sup45-n URA3] plasmid but with different efficiency. The plasmid pRS316 bearing mutant sup45-n alleles were lost in 15–20% of tested colonies (data not shown). At the same time a very small number of colonies lost pRS315 plasmid with wildtype SUP45. (Table 1, first column). These data are consistent with the result of plasmid shuffle on 5-FOA (Fig. 4A and 4D): again the least frequency of wild-type plasmid loss (0.3%) was obtained for sup45-105 and the highest (6.3%) for sup45-101.
Ura+ Leu- colonies were selected and tested for adenine and tryptophan auxotrophy. In all cases sup45-n mutations led to suppression of ade1-14 and trp1-289 (Figure 4B). Cells bearing pRS316/sup45-n plasmid were re-transformed with pRS315-SUP45 plasmid and the experiment repeated (Table 1, second column). The results show that after growth in the presence of mutant alleles of SUP45 the ability to lose the plasmid with the wild-type allele of SUP45 increased. To determine whether such an increase could be explained by reversions of sup45-n alleles to wild-type allele during shuffle experiments in yeast, the corresponding plasmids were prepared from yeast transformants and sequenced. In all tested cases the presence of sup45-n mutation was confirmed (data not shown).

Do nonsense mutations in the SUP45 gene lead to lethality in meiosis?
Previously it has been shown that sup45 nonsense mutants, selected in the presence of SUQ5, are not viable in
the absence of the SUQ5 tRNA suppressor [29]. In our work such mutants are viable for three distinct yeast
strains all of which do not contain SUQ5. Thus the main  ifference between our data and previously published
data [29] may be explained by different approaches to selection the mutants used. In addition, in our work, plasmid shuffle analysis was used to test the viability of sup45-n mutants as analysis of meiotic products has been used to characterize the viability of sup45-0 (0 because of ochre) mutants [29].
To compare our results to the ones of Stansfield et al. [29] we transformed diploid strain D1628 (a parent strain for 1A-D1628 strain used in plasmid shuffle experiment) heterozygous for SUP45 disruption with plasmids carrying  sup45-n alleles and performed tetrad analysis. Table 2 shows that no His+ Ura+ segregants were obtained in the case of the sup45-105 allele (where His+ is the marker for the SUP45 gene disruption and Ura+ – for the plasmid presence). This result cannot be explained by the loss of the corresponding plasmid since the stability of plasmids in all tested diploids were practically the same (Table 2). For all other sup45-n alleles the appearance of His+ Ura+ segregants has been registered, although their amount was less than in the case of plasmids with wild-type SUP45. The presence of sup45-n alleles in His+Ura+ spore clones was confirmed by suppression of ade1-14 and trp1-289 alleles (data not shown).
