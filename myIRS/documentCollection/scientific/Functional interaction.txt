?lar Allas1, Aivar Liiv2 and Jaanus Remme*1
Abstract
Background: RNase III is a dsRNA specific endoribonuclease which is involved in the primary
processing of rRNA and several mRNA species in bacteria. Both primary structural elements and
the secondary structure of the substrate RNA play a role in cleavage specificity.
Results: We have analyzed RNase III cleavage sites around both ends of pre-23 S rRNA in the
ribosome and in the protein-free pre-rRNA. It was found that in the protein-free pre-23 S rRNA
the main cleavage site is at position (-7) in respect of the mature 5' end. When pre-23 S rRNA was
in 70 S ribosomes or in 50 S subunits, the RNase III cleavage occurred at position (-3). We have
demonstrated that RNase III interacts with both ribosomal subunits and with even higher affinity
with 70 S ribosomes. Association of RNase III with 70 S ribosomes cannot be dissociated by poly(U)
RNA indicating that the binding is specific.
Conclusions: In addition to the primary and secondary structural elements in RNA, protein
binding to substrate RNA can be a determinant of the RNase III cleavage site.
Background
In Escherichia coli, each of the seven rRNA operons is transcribed as a 30 S precursor containing functional gene products – 16 S, 23 S, 5 S and tRNA(s). In addition, 30 S precursor molecules contain extra sequences in the beginning and end of structural genes and in between, as well. These additional sequences are removed by a series of processing events [1]. Enzymes involved in rRNA processing have been the subject of extensive studies, but a full understanding of this important process is still incomplete [reviewed in [1,2]]).
RNase III is the best studied enzyme involved in rRNA processing. RNase III is highly conserved in the eubacteria and orthologs occur in fungi, plants and animals [3,4]. In E. coli RNase III is encoded by the rnc gene [5], which maps at 55 minutes. It is a double-stranded RNA specific enzyme [6], which is active as a 52 kDa homodimer [7] and requires a divalent metal ion (preferably Mg2+) for activity [8]. In addition to the secondary structure of substrate RNA, both positive (determinants) and negative (antideterminants) sequence elements are important in determining the cleavage site [2]. In Escherichia coli, sequences flanking both 16 S RNA and
23 S RNA contain complementary sequence tracts that can form double-stranded regions enclosing the sequences of the mature species of 16 S and 23 S [9]. These helices are known as processing stems. As a result of RNase III cleavage, pre-16 S and pre-23 S precursor molecules are released [10]. This event has been shown to occur during transcription of rRNA [11]. Only 1–2% of rRNA is present  as long precursors in wild-type bacteria [12]. The final maturation of rRNA molecules depends on the formation of the complex of rRNA and r-proteins and requires participation of other ribonucleases [1]. Bacteria lacking RNase III activity are viable, although
slow growth and defective translation of some specific mRNA's has been attributed to the lack of the enzyme
[11]. In these strains, other ribonucleases are responsible for the formation of 16 S and 23 S precursors. However, these precursors are somewhat larger than the precursors formed by RNase III cleavage [13]. Unlike 16 S rRNA, the mature ends of 23 S rRNA are not formed in the RNase IIInegative strains [1].
RNase III processing sites in the 23 S precursor have been localized at 3 and 7 nucleotides upstream from the mature 23 S rRNA 5' terminus [14,15] and at 8 nucleotides downstream from the 3' terminus [16]. In 23 S rRNA, initial cleavage by RNase III is indispensable for maturation, and no mature 23 S RNA is found in RNase III? strains [16]. The mature 5' terminus of 23 S rRNA is formed in ribosomes by an unknown enzyme. This seems to be endoribonuclease, because no intermediates have been observed. The maturation of the 3' terminus requires RNase T [17]. RNase III was tought to cleave both strands of the 23 S processing stem simultaneously in a staggered fashion. However, more recently it has been demonstrated, that the maturation of the 5' end of 23 S rRNA occurs independently of that at the 3' terminus [17]. Interestingly, there is a reciprocal dependency between RNase III activity and ribosome assembly, the mature 5' end of 16 S rRNA and both mature ends of 23 S rRNA are known to be formed only in assembled ribosomes [1]. On the other hand, a temperature-sensitive mutation in ribosomal protein S12, which affects small subunit assembly, has been found to be suppressed by a mutation in RNase III [18]. In the present work we have compared RNase III cleavage  sites on different forms of precursor 23 S rRNA in vitro. It was found that RNase III cleaves pre-23 S rRNA in ribosomes at position 3 nucleotides upstream from the mature 5' terminus of 23 S rRNA. Deproteinized rRNA from the rnc- strain and in vitro transcribed rRNA were cleaved by RNase III at position (-7). Thus, the specificity of RNase III cleavage is altered by the presence of ribosomal proteins. We have also shown that RNase III binds to the ribosomes. 
Binding to the 70 S ribosomes is stronger when compared to the dissociated subunits.


Results and discussion
In order to analyze the possible link between ribosome assembly and RNase III processing events we have isolated ribosomes from RNase III negative and from the wild-type strains. In the absence of RNase III the extended version of 23 S rRNA accumulates in the ribosome [9,16]. The primer extension identified most of the 5' ends of 23 S rRNA at positions (-42) – (-45) (data not shown). However,  a significant fraction of the 5' ends were located in the helix 1 region of mature 23 S rRNA (positions 3–6). These results are in agreement with the earlier observations [15,16]. Pre-23 S rRNA was cleaved by RNase III in the ribosomes and after removal of ribosomal proteins. After treatment of 70 S ribosomes or 50 S subunits with RNase III, the main 5' end of 23 S rRNA was at position (-3) (Fig. 1). In contrast, if ribosomal proteins were removed by phenol extraction, the main RNase III cleavage on the naked pre-23 S rRNA occurred at position (-7), although very little cleavage also occurred at position (-3). The in vitro transcribed, unmodified 30 S rRNA precursor from the rrnB operon was cleaved by RNase III preferentially at position (-7) (Fig. 1). These results clearly demonstrate that the specificity of RNase III is altered by the presence of ribosomal proteins. It is interesting to note that the RNase III cleavage site in the ribosomes (-3) is closer to the ribosomal body when compared to the cleavage site in the free rRNA (-7). Therefore, the presence of r-proteins in the 50 S subunit does not protect or mask the distal cleavage site.
We assume that binding RNase III to the ribosomes directs the cleavage at position (-3). Next, we have analyzed the 5' end of 23 S rRNA in the 70 S ribosomes and in the 50 S subunits of the wild-type strain (RNase III positive strain; see Fig. 1). Only the mature 5' end was found in the 70 S ribosomes, while the 50 S subunits contain a significant fraction of 5' ends at position (-3). Final maturation of 23 S rRNA is known to occur in 70 S ribosomes or in polysomes [14]. Thus, the 50 S subunits with extended 23 S rRNA represent newly formed 50 S subunits which have not been in 70 S. Moreover, the fact that in the 50 S subunits 23 S rRNA has a 5' end at position (-3) suggests that RNase III cleavage occurs after the 50 S subunits are assembled. Srivastava and Schlessinger have proposed that RNase III cleavage of prerRNA occurs on the level of ribonucleoprotein particles [1]. Our results confirm this. The fact that rRNA cleavage by RNase III happens after the r-proteins are associated with the 23 S rRNA supports the view that ribosomal large subunit assembly is coupled to the transcription of 23 S rRNA [19]. In similar experiments we have analyzed RNase III cleavage
sites on the 3' strand of pre-23 S rRNA. The cleavage sites were determined by S1 nuclease mapping. In the
wild-type strain, the 3' end of 23 S rRNA was heterogeneous, in addition to the known 3' end the molecules one or two nucleotides shorter were also found (Fig. 2). Similar heterogeneity at the 3' end of 23 S rRNA was also observed by others (e. g. in [17]). When ribosomes were isolated from the wild-type, RNase III treatment did not have any effect on the 3' end of 23 S rRNA either in the ribosomes or in the free rRNA.
50 S subunits isolated from the RNase III-negative strain CAG1632 contain extensions 43, 44, and <45  nucleotides at the 3' end (data not shown). 70 S ribosomes and 50 S subunits, isolated from RNase III-negative strain, were treated by RNase III. Two cleavage sites corresponding to positions (+2) and (+3) in respect of the canonical 3' end of 23 S rRNA were identified by S1 mapping (Fig. 2). The same cleavage sites were found when the ribosomal proteins were removed prior to the RNase III cleavage reaction. Thus, in contrast to the RNase III cleavage at the 5' end of pre-23 S rRNA, the cleavage at the 3' end is not influenced by the presence of the ribosomal proteins. On the in vitro transcribed rrnB 30 S precursor RNase III cleaves the 23 S rRNA 3' strand at position (+8). This site has been recognized before as the RNase III cleavage site [16]. The results presented here suggest that the RNase III cleavage site before ribosomal assembly is at position (+8). When 50 S subunits are formed, the RNase III cleaves at positions (+2) and (+3). RNase III cleavage sites on the processing stem of pre-23 S rRNA are summarized in Fig. 3.

Conclusions
1. The specificity of RNase III is altered by the presence of ribosomal proteins.
2. RNase III binds to both the isolated ribosomal subunits and with an even higher affinity to the 70 S ribosomes.

Materials and methods
Strains and plasmids
E. coli strains XL1-Blue (supE44 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA46 thi relA1 lac- F'(proAB+lacIqLacZ ?M15 Tn10(tetr)) and rnc--deficient strain CAG1632 (F- his bio RNase IRNase III- relA recA56 srl::Tn10; [23]) were used for isolation of the ribosomes. Modified strain BL'21 (DE3) carrying plasmid pET-15b [rnc-wt] was kind gift from Dr. A. Nicholson (Detroit, USA). Originally RecA strain was changed into RecA- and contains a point mutation in the chromosomal rnc gene, causing the synthesis of catalytically inactive RNase III from the chromosome. Plasmid pET-15b [rnc-wt] contains rnc gene encoding RNase III between BamHI and NdeI sites under the control of the late promoter of T7 bacteriophage. Plasmid pARXho containing rrnB operon with XhoI site downstream of 5S gene was a kind gift from Dr. Rolf Wagner (University of D?sseldorf, Germany).


Transcription in vitro

Plasmid pAR-Xho was used for transcription of 30 S precursor corresponding to rrnB. pAR-Xho was linearized by Xho I. Linearized plasmid was purified form the mixture using UltraClean™ 15 kit (MoBio Laboratories).
Transcription was carried out in 50 µl buffer (50 mM NH4Cl; 40 mM Tris, pH 7,9; 20 mM MgCl2; 2 mM   spermidine; 1 mM DTT), in the presence of 2,5 mM rNTP, 0,1 µg linear template DNA, 20 units RNasine and T7 RNA polymerase. Reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour in the presence of optimized amount of RNase III or without the enzyme.

Ribosomes and rRNA
XL-1 Blue and CAG1632 cells were grown in 2xYT medium up to A600 = 0.9. Cells were lysed and ribosomes
fractionated by sucrose gradient (10–25%) centrifugation in SW-28 by ù2t = 2,8 ? 1011 as described previously [15]. Ribosomes were collected by ethanol precipitation. Ribosomes were deproteinized by phenol and chloroform extractions followed by ethanol precipitation of rRNA.

Mapping of 5' ends
RNase III cleavage sites around the 5' end of 23 S rRNA were identified by reverse transcriptase primer extension using the primer 5'-CGCCTCTGACTGCCAGGGC-3' (complementary to the bases 3529–3547 of rrnB operon, numbering according to [24]) as described [15]. AMV reverse transcriptase was from Seikagaku (Japan). The same primer was used for DNA sequencing by T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Mapping of 3' ends
RNase III cleavage sites at the 3' side of pre-23 S rRNA were determined by S1 mapping. Single stranded DNA complementary to the positions 6374–6540 (numbering according to [24]) was labelled by [á32P]-ddATP using terminal transferse (Fermentas, Lithuania) according to manufacturers recommendations. ccDNA probe (1 pmol)
was mixed with 4 pmoles of rRNA and hybridized in 20 µl buffer H (0.1 M HEPES, pH 7,8; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 M NaCl) at 65°C for 20 min. 300 µl of buffer S (280 mM NaCl; 4.5 mM ZnSO4; 50 mM NaOAc pH 4.5; herring sperm DNA 20 µg/ml) and 10 units S1 nuclease (Fermentas, Lithuania) were added. Incubation was 40 min. at 37°C. Reaction was stopped by EDTA/NaCl and phenol extraction of DNA. Products were separated by 10% urea-PAGE.
